In addition, specific object locations within the image are given, along with detailed coordinates. These coordinates are in the form of bounding boxes, represented as (x1, y1, x2, y2) with floating numbers ranging from 0 to 1. These values correspond to the top left x, top left y, bottom right x, and bottom right y.\n\nUsing the provided caption and bounding box information, describe the scene in a detailed manner.\n\nInstead of directly mentioning the bounding box coordinates, utilize this data to explain the scene using natural language. Include details like object counts, position of the objects, relative position between the objects.\n\nWhen using the information from the caption and coordinates, directly explain the scene, and do not mention that the information source is the caption or the bounding box.  Always answer as if you are directly looking at the image."
