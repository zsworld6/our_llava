      "pred": "Figures of speech are words or phrases that use language in a nonliteral or unusual way. They can make writing more expressive. Anaphora is the repetition of the same word or words at the beginning of several phrases or clauses. Antithesis involves contrasting opposing ideas within a parallel grammatical structure. Apostrophe is a direct address to an absent person or a nonhuman entity. Assonance is the repetition of a vowel sound in a series of nearby words. Chiasmus is an expression in which the second half parallels the first but reverses the order of words. Understatement involves deliberately representing something as less serious or important than it really is. The text uses apostrophe, a direct address to an absent person or a nonhuman entity.

      "pred": "An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. The shape of an animal's mouth is one example of an adaptation. Animals' mouths can be adapted in different ways. For example, a large mouth with sharp teeth might help an animal tear through meat. A long, thin mouth might help an animal catch insects that live in holes. Animals that eat similar food often have similar mouths. Look at the picture of the cougar. The cougar has a large mouth and sharp teeth. Its mouth is adapted to tear through meat. The cougar uses its large mouth to grab its prey. It uses its sharp teeth to cut up the meat of the prey into pieces it can swallow. Now look at each animal. Figure out which animal has a similar adaptation. The tiger has a large mouth and sharp teeth. Its mouth is adapted to tear through meat. The marmot has a short, thick mouth. Its mouth is not adapted to tear through meat. The marmot uses its mouth to break off pieces of food that it can swallow. The answer is A.",

      "pred": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes, and the types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke. In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same, and the types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change, and changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change. Erosion caused by wind and ice melting in a cup are both physical changes. The wind carries away tiny pieces of rock in erosion, and the ice melts into liquid water, but both processes keep the same type of matter. Therefore, the answer is D.",

      "pred": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke. In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change. Step 1: Think about each change. Milk going sour is a chemical change. The type of matter in the milk slowly changes. The new matter that is formed gives the milk its sour taste. Baking a loaf of bread is a chemical change. The type of matter in the dough changes when it is baked. The dough turns into bread! Step 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling. The answer is D.",

      "pred": "Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving. The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving. Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature. What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70\u00b0F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70\u00b0F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy. The two oranges are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the hotter orange has more thermal energy. The answer is B.",

He says, \"My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth.\" Scholars have long debated the exact meaning of the phrase, but many claim that Job is saying that he narrowly escaped death. The allusion \"by the skin of his teeth\" means just barely. The answer is A.",

      "pred": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke. In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change. Rust forming on a metal gate is a chemical change. As the gate rusts, the metal turns into a different type of matter called rust. Rust is reddish-brown and falls apart easily. Saliva breaking down a piece of bread is a chemical change. When saliva breaks down the bread, the type of matter in it changes. The bread turns into a different type of matter called sugar. Sugar is a different type of matter than the bread. Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes. The answer is C.",

The color, texture, and covering of an animal's skin are examples of adaptations. Animals' skins can be adapted in different ways. For example, skin with thick fur might help an animal stay warm. Skin with sharp spines might help an animal defend itself against predators. The blue poison dart frog has poisonous glands in its brightly colored skin. Its skin is adapted to ward off predators. The bright colors serve as a warning sign that the blue poison dart frog is poisonous.

      "pred": "Gravitational potential energy is stored between any two objects. So, for every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth. The amount of gravitational potential energy stored between an object and Earth depends on the mass of the object. The amount of gravitational potential energy also depends on the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower. If the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. When an object's mass stays the same and its distance from the center of Earth increases, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth also increases. In the context of Edgar hiking toward the summit of the mountain, the distance between Edgar and the center of Earth increased, so the gravitational potential energy stored between Edgar and Earth increased. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) increased.",

      "pred": "Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles, called north and south. Here are some examples of magnets. The north pole of each magnet is marked N, and the south pole is marked S. If different poles are closest to each other, the magnets attract. The magnets in the pair below attract. If the same poles are closest to each other, the magnets repel. The magnets in both pairs below repel. To find out if these magnets will attract or repel, look at which poles are closest to each other. The north pole of one magnet is closest to the north pole of the other magnet.

Cats meow to talk with their humans!\nIf you are a cat owner, you may be interested in understanding your cat's meows. Different meows can have distinct meanings. A short, high squeak or chirp is a cheerful hello. A louder and longer meow is a cat's way of saying \"Please?\" or \"Let me out!\" An even longer and louder meow is your cat's way of demanding something, like \"Food! Now!\" Of course, the best cat sound to many cat owners is a low, rumbling purr that comes from a happy cat.\nOptions: (A) to act like kittens (B) to talk to other cats (C) to talk to people",

      "pred": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break, and the atoms then link together to form different molecules. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air, breaking the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break, and the types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change, and changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Baking cookies is a chemical change, as the type of matter in the cookie dough changes when it is baked.

      "pred": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke. In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change. Baking cookies is a chemical change. The type of matter in the cookie dough changes when it is baked. The cookie dough turns into cookies! Water evaporating from a puddle is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The water changes from a liquid to a gas. But it is still made of water. Both changes are caused by heating.",

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nRobert was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Robert put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nOptions: (A) how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour (B) if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour (C) whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour",

Jellyfish and sea anemone, for example, are both part of the phylum Cnidaria. Cnidaria comes from a Greek word that means \"nettle,\" a stinging type of plant. Cnidarians are known for the tentacles that surround their mouths, which they use to sting and capture prey. All species that belong in the Cnidaria phyla live exclusively in the ocean.\nAnother phylum of invertebrates found only in oceans is the Echinodermata, a term that comes from Greek words meaning \"spiny\" and \"skin.\" Echinoderms, members of this phylum, have stiff bodies and often have stiff, sharp spines covering their skins. Unlike a cnidarian's wavy tentacles, these spines are used for protection, not to capture prey.\nOptions: (A) echinoderm (B) cnidarian",

Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nWind turbines use wind power to produce electricity. Tori was a materials engineer who designed wind turbines. She wanted to design a new turbine that would produce 10% more electricity than older wind turbines. She thought that a turbine made from lightweight material would turn more easily and produce more electricity. So, Tori created a computer model of a turbine made from lightweight material. Then she used the model to calculate how much more electricity the new turbine could produce compared to the older turbines.\nFigure: studying a wind turbine computer model.\nOptions: (A) if the new turbine could turn easily (B) how much the new turbine would weigh (C) whether the new turbine could produce 10% more electricity",

For example, a dog will naturally salivate at the smell of food (an unconditioned response). However, if a dog learns that the sound of a ringing bell is a sure sign that dinner is coming, it will begin to react to the sound of that bell the same way it reacts to the smell of food (a conditioned response). This is called classical conditioning.\nOperant conditioning is a process like classical conditioning. However, in classical conditioning, the events that an animal learns to associate are not under the animal's voluntary control. In operant conditioning, an external event that is either a reward or punishment becomes linked with a voluntary behavior. For example, a student who receives a gold star for sitting quietly is more likely to choose to sit quietly in the future. The behavior (sitting quietly) has become linked in the student's mind with the reward that it produced in the past. Animal trainers rely on operant conditioning to encourage desired behaviors and discourage unwanted ones.\nOptions: (A) operant conditioning (B) classical conditioning",

Millions of people have welcomed cats into their homes. Indeed, researchers believe that the relationship between cats and humans goes back to prehistoric times. But throughout history, different cultures and people around the world have had different sentiments about cats. Such feelings have ranged from fear to worship.\nPeople probably first developed friendly relationships with cats around eight thousand years ago, when farming and agriculture had just started to develop in the Middle East. Farmers were growing and storing grain, which in turn attracted mice and other pests. Cats were wild then. However, they were likely drawn to farming communities because there were mice to hunt. The farmers would have noticed and appreciated these visitors. To keep the cats around, these early farmers may have given food and even shelter to the wild cats. The farmers and cats probably helped one another.\nIt wasn't until five thousand years later that the Egyptians started to treat cats as pets. Cats in ancient Egypt were not simply valued, but considered sacred. In paintings, many Egyptian goddesses took the form of cats. People who were caught harming cats were punished severely. Some cats were even made into mummies when they died. Normally, only the richest and most powerful people were buried this way.\nLater in history, some societies thought of the cat as evil. In Europe during the Middle Ages, black cats were especially feared. Some believed that witches turned themselves into black cats at night. The connection between witches and black cats lasted for many years. The idea traveled from Europe to North America as Europeans settled there. However, today cats of all colors are beloved by millions of people worldwide. In fact, the way some house cats are treated now might make their Egyptian ancestors jealous!\nOptions: (A) The cats were thought to be visiting goddesses. (B) The cats hunted and brought food to the farmers. (C) The cats helped keep the farmers' grain free of mice. (D) The cats helped farmers find better places to store grain.",

      "pred": "Gravitational potential energy is stored between any two objects. So, for every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth.

This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower. If the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. The table below shows how this change can happen. When an object's mass stays the same and its distance from the center of Earth increases, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth also increases. When the distance decreases, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth also decreases. When the distance stays the same, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth also stays the same.

      "pred": "A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent. The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent. In Solution A and Solution B, the yellow particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of yellow particles, look at both the number of yellow particles and the volume of the solvent in each container. Use the concentration formula to find the number of yellow particles per milliliter. Solution B has more yellow particles per milliliter. So, Solution B has a higher concentration of yellow particles. The answer is C.",

      "pred": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke. In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change. Erosion caused by wind and beating an egg are both physical changes. The wind carries away tiny pieces of rock in erosion. The pieces of rock do not become a different type of matter. Similarly, beating an egg breaks the egg's shell. The shell breaks into pieces. But each piece is still made of the same type of matter. Therefore, the answer is Both are only physical changes.",

A glass of milk has a volume of about 8 fluid ounces, or 1 cup, while a jug of milk has a volume of 1 gallon. Therefore, 75 fluid ounces and 75 cups are both too little, making the answer C.",

Choose the most likely ratio.\nContext: This passage describes the ground spot color trait in watermelon plants:\nWatermelon plants grow with their fruit resting on the ground. Over time, the bottom of each fruit develops a white or yellow spot called a ground spot. In some types of watermelon plants, the color of the ground spot is an inherited trait.\nIn a group of watermelon plants, some individuals have a yellow ground spot and others have a white ground spot. In this group, the gene for the ground spot color trait has two alleles. The allele for a white ground spot (g) is recessive to the allele for a yellow ground spot (G).\nThis Punnett square shows a cross between two watermelon plants.\nOptions: (A) 4:0 (B) 3:1 (C) 1:3 (D) 0:4 (E) 2:2",

The answer is E.\n\nA Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.\n\nIn a group of watermelon plants, some individuals have a yellow ground spot and others have a white ground spot. In this group, the gene for the ground spot color trait has two alleles. The allele for a white ground spot (g) is recessive to the allele for a yellow ground spot (G). Yellow is a dominant allele, so if a fruit has a yellow ground spot, it will produce offspring with a yellow ground spot. On average, these offspring will make up 2/3 of the total offspring. White is a recessive allele, so if a fruit has a white ground spot, it will produce offspring with a white ground spot. On average, these offspring will make up 1/3 of the total offspring.",

Dolphins whistle, birds sing, and wolves howl. In recent years, researchers have paid more attention to animal \"languages,\" and they have made some surprising discoveries. Egyptian fruit bats, for example, have a very complex way of talking to one another. In fact, they are one of the few animals that direct their calls to another individual. Most animals make calls to their entire group. Bats can also share more complex information than other animals. This is because they have special sounds to communicate specific issues.\nResearchers at Tel Aviv University in Israel wanted to learn more about what bats are really saying to one another. First, scientist Yossi Yovel and his team recorded sound and video of twenty-two bats. Fifteen thousand bat calls were collected over a period of seventy-five days. Then, the researchers tried to match each bat call with a behavior. They used special software to help them tell different bat calls apart and decipher the bats' messages.\nWhat Yovel and his team found was astonishing. Egyptian fruit bats are not just making squeaky noises; they are expressing very distinct concerns. One type of call means the bats are arguing over food. Another type of call means the bats are figuring out where they are going to sleep. A third call is used when one bat has gotten too close to another.\nThe researchers made another startling discovery. A bat can alter the sound of its call when addressing different members of the group. This is similar to how humans may use a different tone of voice when speaking to different people. It turns out that bats use language as a way to communicate their needs to each other, almost like humans do.\nOptions: (A) They can communicate with many kinds of animals. (B) They can communicate about specific problems. (C) They can understand some human speech.",

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nCaden was a mechanical engineer who was designing to record temperature, precipitation, and wind speed. The weather station would be used in a town where the highest recorded temperature was 40\u00b0C. Caden wanted to make sure the weather station would work even in unusually warm weather.\nSo, he set an indoor test chamber to 50\u00b0C with low moisture and no wind. He left the weather station in the chamber overnight. The next day, he checked to see if the weather station displayed accurate measurements after 24 hours at 50\u00b0C.\nFigure: a weather station.\nOptions: (A) how well the weather station would work when it was windy (B) if the weather station would work when the temperature was 50\u00b0C",

He then checked if the weather station displayed accurate measurements after 24 hours at 50\u00b0C, indicating whether it would work at that temperature.\nConclusion: Therefore, the test conducted by Caden could demonstrate the functionality of the weather station at 50\u00b0C.",

Other fossils, such as footprints or burrows, are formed from traces of an organism's activities. Fossils are typically found in sedimentary rocks, which usually form in layers. Over time, new layers are added on top of old layers in a series called a rock sequence. The layers in an undisturbed rock sequence are in the same order as when they formed. So, the deeper layers are older than the shallower layers. The relative ages of fossils can be determined from their positions in an undisturbed rock sequence. Older fossils are usually in deeper layers, and younger fossils are usually in shallower layers. Compare the positions of these fossils to determine which one is older: The palm leaf fossil is in a deeper layer in the rock sequence than the wood fossil. So, the palm leaf fossil is most likely older than the wood fossil. The answer is B.",

When Quincy hit the hockey puck, it slid quickly toward Roger's goal.\nOptions: (A) increased (B) stayed the same (C) decreased",
      "pred": "Gravitational potential energy is stored between any two objects. So, for every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth. The amount of gravitational potential energy stored between an object and Earth depends on the mass of the object. The amount of gravitational potential energy also depends on the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower. If the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. The table below shows how this change can happen. When an object's mass stays the same and its distance from the center of Earth increases, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth also increases. When the distance decreases, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth also decreases. When the distance stays the same, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth also stays the same. Think about how the distance between the hockey puck and the center of Earth changed. The hockey puck moved toward Roger's goal, which means the distance between the hockey puck and the center of Earth decreased.
