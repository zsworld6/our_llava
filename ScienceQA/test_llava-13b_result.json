    "4": "Figures of speech are words or phrases that use language in a nonliteral or unusual way. They can make writing more expressive. Anaphora is the repetition of the same word or words at the beginning of several phrases or clauses. Antithesis involves contrasting opposing ideas within a parallel grammatical structure. Apostrophe is a direct address to an absent person or a nonhuman entity. Assonance is the repetition of a vowel sound in a series of nearby words. Chiasmus is an expression in which the second half parallels the first but reverses the order of words. Understatement involves deliberately representing something as less serious or important than it really is. The text uses apostrophe, a direct address to an absent person or a nonhuman entity. Sing, O goddess, the anger of Achilles son of Peleus, that brought countless ills upon the Achaeans directly addresses the goddess, an absent person. The answer is B.",

    "2785": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke. In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change. Step 1: Think about each change. Milk going sour is a chemical change. The type of matter in the milk slowly changes. The new matter that is formed gives the milk its sour taste. Baking a loaf of bread is a chemical change. The type of matter in the dough changes when it is baked. The dough turns into bread! Step 2: Look at each answer choice. Both are only physical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes. Both are chemical changes. Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different. Both are caused by heating. Neither change is caused by heating. Both are caused by cooling. Neither change is caused by cooling. The answer is D.",

Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait. An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene. An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait. Rover's observable version of the fur length trait is long fur.

Other fossils, such as footprints or burrows, are formed from traces of an organism's activities. Fossils are typically found in sedimentary rocks, which usually form in layers. Over time, new layers are added on top of old layers in a series called a rock sequence. The layers in an undisturbed rock sequence are in the same order as when they formed. So, the deeper layers are older than the shallower layers. The relative ages of fossils can be determined from their positions in an undisturbed rock sequence. Older fossils are usually in deeper layers, and younger fossils are usually in shallower layers. Compare the positions of these fossils to determine which one is older: The crocodile egg fossil is in a deeper layer in the rock sequence than the palm leaf fossil. So, the crocodile egg fossil is most likely older than the palm leaf fossil. The answer is A.",

    "5208": "Organisms that carry out photosynthesis are called photosynthetic organisms. During photosynthesis, these organisms use light energy, carbon dioxide, and water to produce sugars and oxygen. Photosynthetic organisms also often have the following characteristics: They are producers, which are organisms that make their own food inside their cells. Because producers make their own food, they typically do not eat other organisms. Their cells contain chloroplasts, which are cell structures where photosynthesis occurs. Their chloroplasts often contain a green substance called chlorophyll. Chlorophyll captures light energy from the Sun to power photosynthesis. They use the sugars they produce during photosynthesis as food. This food provides energy that helps the organisms live, grow, and reproduce. The text tells you that giant kelp use carbon dioxide and water to make food inside their cells. This is evidence that the giant kelp is a photosynthetic organism. The text does not provide evidence that the leafy sea dragon is photosynthetic. The answer is B.",

The amount of gravitational potential energy stored between an object and Earth depends on the mass of the object. The amount of gravitational potential energy also depends on the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower. If the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. When an object's mass stays the same and its distance from the center of Earth increases, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth increases.

In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change. Rust forming on a metal gate is a chemical change. As the gate rusts, the metal turns into a different type of matter called rust. Rust is reddish-brown and falls apart easily. Saliva breaking down a piece of bread is a chemical change.

    "9883": "Gravitational potential energy is stored between any two objects. So, for every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth. The amount of gravitational potential energy stored between an object and Earth depends on the mass of the object. The amount of gravitational potential energy also depends on the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower. If the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. The table below shows how this change can happen. When an object's mass stays the same and its distance from the center of Earth increases, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth also increases. When the distance decreases, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth also decreases. When the distance stays the same, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth also stays the same. Think about how the distance between the whale and the center of Earth changed. Because the whale swam toward the surface, the distance between the whale and the center of Earth decreased. So, the gravitational potential energy stored between the whale and Earth decreased as the whale swam toward the surface. The answer is C.",

    "12554": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change. In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke. In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change. Erosion caused by wind and beating an egg are both physical changes. The wind carries away tiny pieces of rock in erosion. The pieces of rock do not become a different type of matter. Similarly, beating an egg breaks the egg's shell. The shell breaks into pieces. But each piece is still made of the same type of matter. Therefore, the answer is Both are only physical changes.",

During photosynthesis, these organisms use light energy, carbon dioxide, and water to produce sugars and oxygen. Photosynthetic organisms also often have the following characteristics: They are producers, which are organisms that make their own food inside their cells. Because producers make their own food, they typically do not eat other organisms. Their cells contain chloroplasts, which are cell structures where photosynthesis occurs. Their chloroplasts often contain a green substance called chlorophyll. Chlorophyll captures light energy from the Sun to power photosynthesis. They use the sugars they produce during photosynthesis as food. This food provides energy that helps the organisms live, grow, and reproduce. The text tells you that Tillandsia tectorum air plants make their own food from carbon dioxide and water. These plants get the water they need from the air instead of from the soil.

An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait. An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the pea shape gene. An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles.

Other fossils, such as footprints or burrows, are formed from traces of an organism's activities. Fossils are typically found in sedimentary rocks, which usually form in layers. Over time, new layers are added on top of old layers in a series called a rock sequence. The layers in an undisturbed rock sequence are in the same order as when they formed. So, the deeper layers are older than the shallower layers. The relative ages of fossils can be determined from their positions in an undisturbed rock sequence. Older fossils are usually in deeper layers, and younger fossils are usually in shallower layers. Compare the positions of these fossils to determine which one is older: The palm leaf fossil is in a deeper layer in the rock sequence than the wood fossil. So, the palm leaf fossil is most likely older than the wood fossil. The answer is B.",

    "18503": "Fern plants reproduce using both asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction. Mature ferns have flat leaves called fronds. Ferns have structures that look like small dots on the underside of their fronds, called spore cases. The mature ferns use asexual reproduction to make spores. When the spore cases open, the spores are released. When a spore lands on the ground and germinates, it grows into a small heart-shaped plant. The heart-shaped plant begins the fern's sexual reproduction stage by making eggs and sperm. Ferns live in damp environments, and sperm can swim through small water drops. Self-fertilization happens when a sperm swims to an egg on the same heart-shaped plant, while cross-fertilization happens when the sperm swims to an egg on a nearby plant. Fertilization occurs when a sperm and an egg fuse, and the fertilized egg germinates and grows into a mature fern. The mature fern can make spores and begin the fern life cycle again. Therefore, spores can grow into a heart-shaped plant after they are released.",

    "19156": "Gravitational potential energy is stored between any two objects. So, for every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth. The amount of gravitational potential energy stored between an object and Earth depends on the mass of the object. The amount of gravitational potential energy also depends on the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower. If the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. The table below shows how this change can happen. When an object's mass stays the same and its distance from the center of Earth increases, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth also increases. When the distance decreases, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth also decreases. When the distance stays the same, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth also stays the same. Think about how the distance between the hockey puck and the center of Earth changed. The hockey puck moved toward Roger's goal, which means the distance between the hockey puck and the center of Earth decreased. So, the gravitational potential energy stored between the hockey puck and Earth decreased as the puck slid toward the goal. The answer is C.",

    "21146": "Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule. In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break, and the atoms then link together to form different molecules. Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air, breaking the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns. In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break, and the types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same. A change of state is a type of physical change, and changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Baking cookies is a chemical change, as the type of matter in the cookie dough changes when it is baked.
